# PyGSM - 
This is a project,
for creating a python application for working with GSM  modems (for the time being, neowayM590 and SIM800-900).
The user interface will be implemented using the QT framework, which means that it will also work with the database of messages and users.
Interactive information about calls, SMS messages, network status - will be similar to the android application.
User consol CLI - expands the possibilities for working with a modem. 
The parameters at startup will help to choose the way of working, even if it works as a shadow service.

The project is under development...
